Basic github introduction

## Introduction

I am Allison. I am a sack of meat made up of around 7\*10^27 particles, or something on that order of magnitude at least.

I have a physics degree, though I've never put it to much good use. I currently work doing menial labor \- it pays better than a lot of stuff. I know a little bit of coding, but I'm hoping to learn enough more to be able to use it for a career. In my free time, I do nerd stuff: playing video games and tabletop RPGs, and reading bad sci-fi and fantasy books.
